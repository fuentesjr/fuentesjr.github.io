This guide will help get you started with your knowledge base.\n\n## The Trail 🥾\n\nHere are the basics of Dendron so you can get started growing your knowledge base.\n- [x] Create your first note.\n    - [x] Dendron uses the [lookup](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#lookup-menu) command to create. So, hit CMD+L (or ctrl+L if you're on Windows) to bring up the lookup bar, type in a new note name and hit enter to create it. You can also run the lookup command through the command palette \"Dendron: Lookup\".\n    - [x] Wiki-style links are supported. If the note doesn't exist, we'll create the note for you. For example, just try [[this link]] from the editor view.\n- [x] Find your notes. Dendron really shines when you need to look up notes quickly. For this, you use *drumroll* the lookup command (again). Just hit CMD/ctrl+L and you can search your entire set of notes.\n- [x] To delete a note, navigate to it and use the \"Dendron: Delete Node\" command. As with everything else in VSCode, bring up the command palette with CMD/ctrl+shift+P and run the command.\n- [ ] Use a [snippet](https://www.dendron.so/notes/9eca1992-7540-4d9d-97fb-328b27748b2c.html) for quick note templates\n- [ ] Insert an [image](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a91fd8da-6895-49fe-8164-a17acd8d9a17.html)\n- [ ] Create some [links](https://www.dendron.so/notes/3472226a-ff3c-432d-bf5d-10926f39f6c2.html)\n- [ ] [Publish](https://www.dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html) your vault\n- [ ] Join us on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/6j85zNX) and discuss all things knowledge management with your fellow trail blazers.\n- [ ] For more information, see Dendron's basic [concepts](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html)\n## The Woods 🌲\n\nThis section covers advanced functionality in Dendron.

Dendron is the greek word for tree. It's a reference to the hierarchal note taking that Dendron(3) enables. \n2. Dendron is another word for [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) which is an extension of the nerve cell that sends and receives signals in the brain. Think of Dendron(3) as a digital nervous system that helps you consolidate all the information that you care about in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\n3. Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you build, organize, and share knowledge bases of any size.\n\n## How do I get started?\n\n1. Launch the _command bar_ inside vscode:\n    - Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n    - macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`\n    - Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n2. Paste the following command and press `Enter`:\n\n```sh\n> Dendron: Initialize Workspace\n```\n\n![Initialize workspace](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/dendron-init.gif)\n\nWhen the workspace opens, it will show dialogue to install additional recommended extensions. \n","url":"https://fuentesjr.github.io/notes/05774b2e-ebf7-4bbc-8171-ad191ba0ae0a.html","relUrl":"notes/05774b2e-ebf7-4bbc-8171-ad191ba0ae0a.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"root.changelog","content":"","url":"https://fuentesjr.github.io/notes/changelog.html","relUrl":"notes/changelog.html"}]
