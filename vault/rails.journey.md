Journey is a module written by Aaron Patterson (AKA @tenderlove) that became the routing solution for Rails as of Rails 3.2, and was officially merged with Rails 4 and up.  It is a facinating piece of work involving Computer Science topics/concepts such as GTGs, NFAs, Lexers, Parser, ASTs, and Grammars. Furthermore, it makes use of [[Racc|ruby.parsing.racc]]
